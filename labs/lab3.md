# Lab 3 - Navigation with Jetpack Compose

## Deliverables
Clicking a planet list item should open a details screen
- When viewing the details screen, there should be a back button that navigates back to the previous screen
- Navigation between screens should be done using a `NavHost` and `NavController`
- The app should preserve state across configuration change

## Challenges
- Add an enter or exit animation when navigating to, or from, the details screen
- Add additional details to each `Planet` list item that animates in, and out, when an "info" icon is tapped

## Dev Notes

### Where can I find starter code for this lab?
If something comes up during the training and you have missed any labs up to this point, no worries.

To help get you started, check out the `lab3-start` tag. This will provide you a bootstrapped project that you can start building off of.

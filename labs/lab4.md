# Lab 4 - Refactor and Test Compose UI Architecture

## Deliverables
- Write a Compose test that validates that `PlanetListScreen` draws the expected items that are passed to it.
- Then, refactor you code so the list of planets if observed from a `ViewModel` using an MVVM pattern.
- Use your test to ensure the refactoring didn't impact app behavior

## Challenge
- Implement a different UI for horizontal screen orientation
- Refactor the details screen to use a ViewModel

## Dev Notes

### Where can I find starter code for this lab?
If something comes up during the training and you have missed any labs up to this point, no worries.

To help get you started, check out the `lab4-start` tag. This will provide you a bootstrapped project that you can start building off of.

If you've want to continue building out of your own project, feel free to continue doing so.
